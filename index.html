            <section id="p1">I am an HR Assistant and educator who enjoys data and operations.
                I am currently enrolled in UConn's Coding Bootcamp to gain fullstack skills that will heighten my
                ability to manuever around technology and systems.</p>
                I'm from Bridgeport, Connecticut where I was reared by my mother, Sylvia, and step-father, Michael.
                My mom gave birth to two sets of twins, roughly 18-months apart, so as you might imagine I grew up in a
                house full of personality and a little chaos.
                My siblings and I grew up really close and honestly, they're my inspiration to follow my dreams.
                In 2010, I graduated as Valedictorian of my high school class and in 2014, I graduated with a bachelor's
                in Business Administration from UConn.
                Since graduating I have been on the search to find a career that suits me and my passions.
